# ☁️ Astral Cloud

A small WhatsApp utility bot built with [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).

## Setup

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

On first run, a QR code will print in your terminal. Scan it from
**WhatsApp → Linked Devices → Link a Device**.

Once paired, your session is saved to `auth_info/` — you won't need to
re-scan on future restarts (as long as that folder persists).

## Running with PM2 (recommended for VPS)

```bash
pm2 start index.js --name astral-cloud
pm2 save
```

## Downloaders

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `.play <song name or link>` | Search YouTube and send back the audio as MP3 |
| `.tiktok <url>` | Download a TikTok video (or images) |
| `.ig <url>` | Download an Instagram post/reel |
| `.pinterest <url>` | Download a Pinterest image/video/gif |
| `.fb <url>` | Download a Facebook video/photo |
| `.dl <url>` | Auto-detect the platform and download |

`.play` fetches audio from several sources, in order, and only accepts a
source that actually produced audio bytes:

0. **yt-dlp** (`utils/youtube/ytdlp.js`) — the approach desktop downloaders
   use, and the most reliable of the lot: yt-dlp follows YouTube's anti-bot
   changes (PO tokens, nsig/sig challenges, new player clients) within days.
   Two passes over the same binary:
   - `basic` — the Refloow recipe: `-f bestaudio`, `--js-runtimes
     node:<this bot's node>`, `youtube:player_client=default,web_safari`.
   - `arroxy` — [Arroxy](https://github.com/antonio-orionus/Arroxy)'s retry
     ladder: PO token + visitor data (when `YT_PO_TOKEN` is set) →
     `player_client=default,-web,-web_safari` (VidBee's trick: drop the
     clients that *demand* a token) → yt-dlp's own clients, with
     `--ignore-config`, chunked HTTP, bounded retries and a stop at the first
     rate limit instead of hammering YouTube.

   The binary comes from `YTDLP_PATH`, `<DATA_DIR>/media/bin/`, `yt-dlp` on
   `PATH`, or is downloaded once from the official GitHub release
   (`YTDLP_AUTODOWNLOAD=0` disables that).
1. **YouTube InnerTube** (`utils/youtube/innertube.js`) — several clients are
   tried (TV first, since it still serves audio without a PO token) and the
   first that returns real bytes wins. Highest quality, one request.
2. **Public YouTube APIs** (`utils/youtube/audioApis.js`) — Piped, Invidious,
   cobalt, or your own endpoint, so a blocked server IP still gets audio from
   someone else's. Every response is magic-number checked, so an HTML "rate
   limited" page is never sent as a voice note.
3. **y2mate** (`utils/y2mate/audio.js`) — HTML scraper, last resort.

The winning source is streamed in verified byte ranges to a temp file,
converted to MP3 with ffmpeg, and sent as a WhatsApp audio message (with the
cover art as a thumbnail). If every source refuses, the reply lists one
line per source with its real error, and — when YouTube is the blocker — points
at the env var that fixes it.

Notes:

- Long tracks are re-encoded at a lower bitrate so the MP3 stays under
  WhatsApp's ~16 MB media limit; anything still too large is sent as a
  playable document instead of failing.
- If ffmpeg isn't available the original m4a/webm audio is sent instead.
- YouTube sometimes blocks datacenter IPs ("Sign in to confirm you're not a
  bot"). Optional env vars help there: `YT_PO_TOKEN` (Proof-of-Origin token),
  `YT_VISITOR_DATA`, `YT_COOKIE`, and `YT_CLIENTS` (comma-separated client
  order override, e.g. `TVHTML5,iOS,WEB`).
- yt-dlp knobs: `YTDLP_PATH` (use a specific binary), `YTDLP_AUTODOWNLOAD=0`
  (never fetch it automatically), `YT_EXTRACTOR_ARGS` is not needed — the
  working default is baked in. The binary is stored in `<DATA_DIR>/media/bin/`
  so it survives restarts on hosts with a persistent volume.
- Tune the fallback APIs with:
  - `YT_AUDIO_APIS` — order/list of providers, e.g. `piped,cobalt`, or a bare
    template URL `https://api.example/dl?id={id}` whose JSON/text response
    contains the media link.
  - `PIPED_INSTANCES`, `INVIDIOUS_INSTANCES`, `COBALT_INSTANCES`
    (or `COBALT_API_URL`) — comma-separated base URLs to use instead of the
    built-in public ones. Self-hosted instances are the most reliable fix if
    public ones are slow or down.

`.tiktok`/`.ig`/`.pinterest`/`.fb` use tikwm.com and api-faa.my.id. Those are
third-party scraper APIs, not official platform APIs — they can change or go
down without notice. If one stops working, the fix is updating the relevant
fetch function in `utils/downloaders/fetchers.js`.

Replying to a message that contains a supported link also works for `.dl`.

## Files

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `.7zip` | Reply to an archive to extract it |
| `.7zip add <path/name.ext>` | Reply to a file to add it to the compression queue |
| `.7zip up` | Compress everything in the queue and send it back as a .zip |

`.7zip` auto-downloads a portable 7-Zip binary on first use (into
`media/bin/7ZIP/`) and shells out to it. Queue size, max file size, and
compression timeout can be tuned via `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE`, `MAX_UPLOAD` (in MB),
and `COMPRESS_TIMEOUT` (in ms) environment variables.

## Search

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `.anime <title>` | Search AniList — poster, short synopsis, rating |
| `.movie <title>` / `.omdb <title>` | Search OMDb — poster, short synopsis, IMDb rating |

`.movie`/`.omdb` needs an OMDb API key set as the `OMDB_API_KEY` environment
variable (free key from [omdbapi.com](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)).
`.anime` uses AniList's public GraphQL API and needs no key.

## Group moderation (admin-only)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `.kick @user` | Remove a member (mention, reply, or number) |
| `.add <number>` | Add a member by number |
| `.promote @user` | Make a member admin |
| `.demote @user` | Remove admin status |
| `.tagall <text>` | Mention every member, visibly |
| `.hidetag <text>` | Ping every member without showing the tags |
| `.mute` | Only admins can send messages |
| `.unmute` | Everyone can send messages again |
| `.setname <name>` | Change the group name |
| `.setdesc <text>` | Change the group description |
| `.antilink on/off` | Auto-delete + kick on links |
| `.antistatus on/off` | Auto-delete + kick on Status shares |
| `.antichannel on/off` | Auto-delete + kick on Channel forwards |
| `.antispam on/off` | Auto-delete + kick on rapid message spam |
| `.welcome on/off` | Verify new members with a math check before they can stay |

All anti-features are **ON by default** in every group. Only group admins can
run these commands, and group admins are always exempt from the anti-features
(so an admin sharing a link won't get kicked).

`.welcome` is **OFF by default**. When on: new members get tagged with a
random simple addition question (e.g. `3 + 5 = ?`) and 5 minutes to answer
correctly in the group. Wrong answers are ignored (they can keep trying until
the timer runs out). On a correct answer they're tagged again and asked for
their name, age, best/worst anime, and the year they started watching —
that part is just for fun, nothing is required or stored. If they don't
answer the math question correctly within 5 minutes, the bot removes them
(only if it has admin rights in the group — otherwise it just posts that it
couldn't).

Admin-only commands fire immediately once the sender is confirmed an admin —
they don't pre-check whether the bot itself is a group admin. If the bot
lacks admin rights, the underlying WhatsApp API call fails and the bot
reports it couldn't complete the action.

## Project structure

```

├── index.js              # Entry point — connection + message listener
├── handlers/
│   └── router.js         # Parses commands, dispatches to command modules

└── auth_info/             # Session data (auto-created, gitignored)
```

## Adding a new command

1. Create a new file in `commands/` that exports a function.
2. Import it in `handlers/router.js` and add a `case` in the switch statement.
3. Add it to the menu list in `commands/menu.js`.

## Notes

- Uses `.` as the command prefix (change `PREFIX` in `commands/menu.js`).
- `auth_info/` contains your WhatsApp session — never commit it or share it.
- Deleting `auth_info/` will require re-pairing via QR code.

## Health endpoint

The bot also starts a tiny HTTP server on `$PORT` (default `3000`):

- `GET /` → `☁️ Astral Cloud is running`
- `GET /health` → JSON: `{ ok, bot, uptimeSec, reconnects, lastDisconnectCode }`
  where `bot` is `open`, `connecting`, `closed`, `replaced` or `logged_out`.

Point an uptime pinger (UptimeRobot / cron-job.org) at `/health` to keep a
free web service awake. On Render use Start Command `npm start`.

## MongoDB storage (recommended on Render/other hosts without a disk)

Set these environment variables and the WhatsApp session, group settings,
trusted users and chess games are stored in MongoDB instead of local files,
so they survive restarts and redeploys:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MONGODB_URI` | Connection string, e.g. `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/` |
| `MONGODB_DB` | Optional. Database name (default `astral_cloud`) |
| `BOT_ID` | Optional. Collection prefix (default `astral`). Use a different value per bot if two bots share one database |

Without `MONGODB_URI` the bot keeps using `auth_info/` and `data/` as before.
